# DSA Customiser

## Introduction

- User Experience has been one of the main challenges in the DeFi space especially enagging layman users/users who are non-developers but have good DeFi knowledge

- To Solve this [Instadapp](https://instadapp.io/) we have platforms like Instadapp which focus on User Experience especially where a User can track their respective DeFi   positions through just 1 platforms & recently they introduced [DSA](https://blog.instadapp.io/defi-smart-accounts/) to boost developer enagagement from Non-Blockchain/Non-Ethereum background and of course the users.


#### Our Solution

- We have come up with a solution built on top of DSA through which you can customise your DeFi DSA Spells accross all protocols currently supported by the DSA.
- DSA Customiser is our attempt to build a simple User Friendly layer on top of DSA, by which users can execute spells of their own, track their positions accross various protocols through a simple interface
- Even if you don't have a DSA Created you can get one created by just connecting your Metamask Wallet.
- You can execute any recipie of your choice, you can refer to the InstaDapp DSA [Usecases](https://docs.instadapp.io/usecases/) to get some ideas. 

[NOTE -> Currently we support ETH, DAI & USDC as a submission to this hack & 1 DSA per wallet, we will try and introduce these features later]

### Functionality

1. Start creating your spells by selecting protcools & other information required to create a spell (for eg if you wanna use deposit then just select the deposit operation, choose the applicable protocol, the depositing asset and the amount)
2. You can create any number of spells there is no limit, but keep in mind the gas costs
3. Track your dsa token balances & positions accross various protocols
4. Automatic DSA Login when you connect your wallet
